## 🛠 Configuring Environments

To ensure that your Telegram Auto-Reaction Bot operates correctly, you will need to configure several environment variables in your Cloudflare Worker settings:

- `BOT_TOKEN`: This is your bot's token, which you can generate from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). This token allows your bot to authenticate and interact with the Telegram API.
- `BOT_USERNAME`: The username you have set for your bot. This is used within the script to identify messages intended for your bot.
- `EMOJI_LIST`: A string of emojis that the bot will use to react to messages. You can customize this list to include any emojis you prefer, such as 👍❤🔥🥰👏😁🎉🤩🙏👌🕊😍🐳❤‍🔥💯⚡🏆.
- `RANDOM_LEVEL`: An integer that determines the randomness of reactions in **group chats**. Lower values result in more predictable reactions, while higher values increase randomness. Default is `0`, meaning reactions are consistent by default.
- `RESTRICTED_CHATS`: A list of chat IDs where the bot should not react to messages (Optional). Split each chat ID by " , ". Example : `-1001233434,3434234`

## 🧩 Configure the Webhook
Open your web browser and enter the following URL (replace <YourBotToken> with your actual bot token and https://your.cloudflare.worker.url/ with your Cloudflare Worker URL):
    <br>
    
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/setWebhook?url=https://your.cloudflare.worker.url/
```

**Verify the Webhook Configuration**:
To check if the webhook is set up correctly, navigate to:
    <br>

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/getWebhookInfo
```
